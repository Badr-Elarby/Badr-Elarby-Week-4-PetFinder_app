[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/Badr-Elarby/Badr-Elarby-Week-4-PetFinder_app)

PetFinder App is a mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to discover, view details, and save their favorite cats. It leverages [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to provide an extensive and randomly generated list of cat profiles, showcasing a modern and scalable app architecture.

## Features

-   **Infinite Scrolling:** Discover new cats with an endlessly scrollable home feed.
-   **Detailed Profiles:** Tap any cat to view detailed information, including its breed, origin, life span, weight, and temperament.
-   **Persistent Favorites:** Save your favorite cats for later. Your favorites list is stored locally on your device.
-   **Dynamic Search:** Find specific cats by searching for breed name, origin, or weight.
-   **Responsive UI:** The user interface is built with `flutter_screenutil` to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is built using a **Clean Architecture** approach, promoting a clear separation of concerns, scalability, and testability. The code is organized into feature-based modules.

-   **Framework:** Flutter & Dart
-   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture with a feature-led project structure.
-   **State Management:** BLoC (Cubit) for predictable and efficient state management.
-   **Dependency Injection:** GetIt for managing dependencies and providing services.
-   **Navigation:** GoRouter for declarative routing, including shell routes for the bottom navigation bar.
-   **Networking:** Dio for API requests, featuring a custom interceptor for API key management and logging.
-   **Local Storage:** SharedPreferences for persisting the user's favorite cats.
-   **Testing:** Unit and Widget tests for Cubits, repositories, and UI components using `bloc_test` and `mocktail`.
